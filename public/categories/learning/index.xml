      <description>I’ve been meaning to figure out plumber for a while. Have gone through some of the chapters in the plumber book a couple of times, but nothing has stuck so far.
So I don’t know who I seen say it, but I’m going to try writing about plumber to force myself to learn the tool.
Why? I’m really interested in getting R into production. I work for a company where I’m the only data scientist; most of my work is helping folks understand products better, and do research on techniques / tools that can help us with data focused products.</description>
