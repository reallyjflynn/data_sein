<p>I’ve been meaning to figure out plumber for a while. Have gone through some of the chapters in the plumber book a couple of times, but nothing has stuck so far.</p>
<p>So I don’t know who I seen say it, but I’m going to try writing about plumber to force myself to learn the tool.</p>
<div id="why" class="section level3">
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I’m really interested in getting R into production.
I work for a company where I’m the only data scientist; most of my work is helping folks understand products better, and do research on techniques / tools that can help us with data focused products.</p>
<p>But there is no pipeline for getting R anywhere near production.</p>
<p>The pipeline, when there were other DS people was to have a DS partner with a backend engineer who could then turn Python into Java … Not a great practice.</p>
<p>We work in a google cloud environment, and I’ve worked with AWS in the past.
So having an R -&gt; API -&gt; Docker -&gt; Kubernetes pipeline seems like something that would open up alot of new possibilities in my work.</p>

<p>I’m just going to be going through the quickstart of the plumber bookdown. But supplementing the examples with other data / functions … to force myself to think about what I’m doing and not just copy someone else’s code.</p>

<h3>Quickstart</h3>
<p>Lets assume we know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="API">what an API is</a> and <a href="https://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/installing-r-packages/" title="Install R Packages">how to install packages in R</a> and jump straight to quickstart a</p>
